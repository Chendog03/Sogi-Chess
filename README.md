## About

Sogi is a 16x12 chess variation imagined by my friend and brought to life as a proof of concept in about a week of work. It was my introduction to the real applications of python and my first use of some powerful libraries (see below). The whole project lacks professionalism because I didn't start the project thinking it would go this far. I hope to clean up some of the code in the future.



The game can be run locally from _chess.py_. This version has a historic functionality allowing the players to go back through all the positions in the game, continuing from any point. 

The game can also be run online with _server code.py_ and _sogi client.py_. The network works on TCP for simplicity. The server should be started prior to either player running their client. The first client to join the server plays as white.

### Built With

- Code written in python.
- Tkinter: main GUI
- PIL: to use images with Tkinter
- Twisted: network
- pyinstaller: creating an executable
